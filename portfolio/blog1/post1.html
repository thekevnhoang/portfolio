        <h1> Importance of Individuality</h1>

        <h3>The Mission</h3>
        
        <p>
        Individuality is one of the most important attributes one can have. Especially today where
        social media has become more prevalent than anything, separating yourself from the crowd and
        living for your own passions is one of the biggest keys to a fulfilling life.

        <h3>Whats your Passion?</h3>
        <p>
            If you search up on Google, "What is passion?", this is what you'd find.
        </p>
    <div class>

    </div>
        <p> 
           Ultimately, passion is a strong desire that drives a person to do some pretty
           amazing things they originally thought they wouldn't be able to. Without passion, it's 
           difficult to live a fulfilling life if theres no urge to chase a dream. So, if you haven't found a passion
           yet, think of the top 3 things you like doing the most.
        </p>
        <p>
        	This can range from anything, whether it be a sport you love playing, a strong interest in fashion design,
        	or even just playing video games. A passion can be anything and if you even have the slightest interest in
        	anything, then you my friend have already found a passion. 
        </p>

        <h3>How to Excel</h3>
        <p>
           Now once you've figured what you're good at... or at least enjoy, take this and run with it for awhile.
           Many people tend to believe that in order to have a good passion, you have to be good at it which is 
           completely far from the truth. Sure, some people are naturally talented at certain things, but that doesn't 
           mean you aren't allowed to enjoy it too. Take me for example, I really enjoy dancing and wasn't that great.
           But with a bit of PASSION, emphasis on PASSION, I loved it enough to keep working at it and eventually gained enough
           experience to be able to teach others and just have fun with it. Now since you happened to stumble upon this blog post, you
           get the honor of seeing my first time performing at the ripe young age of 16 to recently at a mall at 22. Ahh, I can still feel the nostalgia.

        <p>
        	Now if that isn't the definition of improvement, I don't know what is, but eventually did learn enough to the point where 
        	I finally was able to perform comfortably and confidently in front of a crowd.
		</p>
		<p>
			Now even though I do love and enjoy dancing, that isn't my number one ambition in life. My goal is to actually become
			a full-stack developer with expertise in front-end web design. By doing so, I hope to one day create a social media platform where not just
			dancers, but all types of aspiring dancers, musicians, artists can share their work on a single platform and grow from one another.
			Dancers could use a sample of an aspiring music producer to create choreographed dance videos and artists can visually create
			pieces that could be used as album art for their project mixtapes and etc.

        <h3>The Takeaway</h3>
        <p> 
        	Now the end goal of this blog post is to remind you that it is possible to find your passion and incorporate it with your
        	work goal. By simultaneously mixing web designing and dance, I'm chasing my dream of creating that social media platform
        	where dancers and artists alike can express and share their created works. Just because you may have a dream of becoming a doctor
        	and a musician at the same time doesn't mean you have to give up one or the other. Finding your passion and figuring out
        	how to get paid doing it should be everyone's end goal. Find out what drives you and instead of keeping it on the side, learn
        	how to make the best of both parts and keep at it so you can live out your dreams and live a fulfilling life.
        </p>
